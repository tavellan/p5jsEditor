# p5jsEditor (for classroom use)

<a href="http://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> is a great JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and available for todayâ€™s web. However to set up your development environment can be difficult for beginners or at least a bit time consuming. This editor is created for classroom use without any extra requirements. The goal is to provide simple and lightweight p5.js playground to get started easily.

If you are looking for a web-development focused professional code editor, this p5jsEditor is not what you are looking for. For example you can download an official p5 editor from <a href="http://p5js.org/download/#editor" target="_blank">here</a>.

This editor is a very much hacked up from <a href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/htmleditor/" target="_blank">Mr.doob's htmleditor</a> and also from its old fork <a href="https://github.com/eee-c/code-editor" target="_blank">ICE Code Editor</a> used in book "3D Game Programming for Kids" by Chris Strom. All things are wired around <a href="http://ace.c9.io/" target="_blank">Ace code editor</a> written in JavaScript. 

TODO:
 - Ace editor update to v1.2.0
 - Multiple language support (currently only Finnish supported)
 - More templates
