# p5jsEditor (for classroom use)

<a href="http://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> is a great JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and available for todayâ€™s web. However to set up your development environment can be difficult for beginners or at least a bit time consuming. If you don't have Administrator's privileges, you can't install software. This editor is created from this point in mind, for classroom use. To provide simple and lightweight access to awesome world of programming without installing anything local.

This a very much hacked up from <a href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/htmleditor/" target="_blank">Mr.doob's htmleditor</a> and also from its old fork <a href="https://github.com/eee-c/code-editor" target="_blank">ICE Code Editor</a> used in book "3D Game Programming for Kids" by Chris Strom. All things are wired around <a href="http://ace.c9.io/" target="_blank">Ace code editor</a> written in JavaScript. 

TODO:
